1/. The content only updated today? If it was only changed in today's text file then likely not in 20th build I would say - **wouldn't hurt to** check though

2/. Given the unforeseen weather conditions, the evacuation drill **originally scheduled for** tomorrow has been postponed.
We **apologize for any inconvenience this may cause to those who** have made arrangements.
We'll **keep you informed** once the new date is **finalized**, which will most likely **be rescheduled to** next year.

3/. the actual auto regression is being run only on the PS checklist because it is more complete. The client said we can regress also on Steam. However, we have decided not to mark the PS checklist using the test from Steam.
I will add some manual regression tomorrow on the files we will use before submission, so some things could be checked on the Steam build tomorrow.
Today I can't think a way for Steam testers to help with this task unfortunately. I am open to ideas if anyone has any we haven't thought.
